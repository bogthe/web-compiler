# Angular2 + Super Tiny Compiler
Status: ![build status](https://travis-ci.org/bogthe/web-compiler.svg?branch=master)

Test out the live version [here!](https://webstc-162d7.firebaseapp.com/)

## Purpose
This angular2 app is a demo showcasing the inner-workings of the super tiny compiler. I am currently using my version which has been TDD-ed after the original. 

- [Original here](https://github.com/thejameskyle/the-super-tiny-compiler) 
- [Own version here](https://github.com/bogthe/super-tdd-compiler)

## Why tho?
This website demo's the `super` capabilities of the super tiny compiler! It displays what each part of the compiler outputs throughout the process. Should make you feel more confident when diving into understanding it! :)

## Supported languages
More about which language the compiler supports [here](https://github.com/bogthe/super-tdd-compiler)

Some inputs you can try:
- `(add 4 7)`
- `(substract 4 (add 7 9 2))`
- Generally speaking `(functionName params...)`
- Write as many as you want and nest them however!

## Found something you don't like?
Head down to the [main repo](https://github.com/bogthe/super-tdd-compiler) and have a go at fixing stuff!

## Credit
I give all credit for the compiler to the original, as I did in my own compilers repo ;)
